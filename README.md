# üÖøÔ∏è PK4U-DB-Scripts: Population Tool for MongoDB
This repository contains Node.js scripts designed to facilitate **initial data population and simulation** in your MongoDB database for the **PK4U (Parking for You)** system. These scripts will allow you to insert parking information and generate parking spot data per floor, which is essential for the application's operation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository, set up your environment, and run the scripts to populate your MongoDB database.

### üìã Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system before proceeding:

* **Node.js**: Version `v18` or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **npm** (Node Package Manager): Automatically included with Node.js installation.
* **MongoDB Atlas (or a local MongoDB instance)**: You will need an accessible MongoDB database for the scripts to interact with. Using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is recommended for quick and easy setup.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jefffer/pk4u-db-scripts.git
cd pk4u-db-scripts
```

### üì¶ Install Dependencies
Once inside the project folder, install the necessary dependencies. Use `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file if it doesn't already exist, then install the libraries:

```bash
npm init -y # Only if you don't have a package.json
npm install mongodb dotenv
```

* `mongodb`: This is the official MongoDB driver for Node.js, essential for the scripts to connect and interact with your database.
* `dotenv`: A lightweight and secure library that loads environment variables from an `.env` file into `process.env`, preventing sensitive credentials from being directly exposed in the source code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration
For the scripts to establish a connection with your MongoDB database, it's crucial to configure your connection string.

1.  In the root of the `pk4u-db-scripts` folder, create a new file named `.env`.
2.  Inside this `.env` file, add your MongoDB Atlas connection string (or the URL of your local MongoDB instance). The format should be as follows:

```bash
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<your-cluster-url>/pk4u?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important!**

Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<your-cluster-url>` with your own credentials and the URL of your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

### üèÉ Run Population Scripts
Once you have cloned the repository and configured the `.env` file, you are ready to run the population script.

To run the `generateSpots.js` script and populate your database:

```bash
node generateSpots.js
```

This script will perform the following actions:

* Connect to your MongoDB database using the connection string provided in the `.env` file.
* Insert predefined parking information (or whatever is configured in the `generateSpots.js` script).
* Generate detailed spot information for each parking level, simulating initial availability.

## üåü What is PK4U?

PK4U is an open-source web application that allows real-time visualization of parking spot availability in various urban establishments. Its objective is to centralize this information on a single accessible platform for citizens, thus improving urban mobility in the context of a Smart City.

### üíª Main Components of PK4U:

The PK4U system consists of several parts, working together to offer a comprehensive parking management solution:

* **Frontend**: The intuitive and reactive user interface developed with **React.js** that allows citizens to view parking lots on an interactive map and check their real-time availability.
    * **Frontend Repository**: [https://github.com/Jefffer/pk4u-frontend](https://github.com/Jefffer/pk4u-frontend)
* **Backend**: The robust server built with **Java** and **Spring Boot** that handles business logic, processes occupancy data updates (simulated by these scripts), and serves information to the Frontend via a RESTful API.
    * **Backend Repository**: [https://github.com/MMunozLo/PK4U-backend.git](https://github.com/MMunozLo/PK4U-backend.git)
* **DB Scripts (This Repository)**: This tool is crucial for initializing and maintaining the database, inserting the spot structure and generating detailed spot information for each floor.
* **Simulator**
* **API Gateway**
* **Eureka**
